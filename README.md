Credit Card Fraud Detection Workflow
This project aims to develop a credit card fraud detection system using a structured workflow that includes data preprocessing, data analysis, model training, and evaluation. The workflow is designed to efficiently process credit card data and utilize a logistic regression model to identify fraudulent transactions.

##Workflow Overview##

Credit Card Data --> Data Preprocessing --> Data Analysis --> Train-Test Split -----------> Logistic Regression Model ----------------> Evaluation 

###Workflow Steps###

###1. Credit Card Data###

The project starts with a dataset containing credit card transactions. This dataset includes transaction amount, time, and anonymized features derived from the original data.

###2. Data Preprocessing###

In this step, we clean and prepare the data for analysis. This includes:

Handling missing values
Scaling numerical features
Encoding categorical variables
Splitting the data into features (X) and labels (y)

###3. Data Analysis###

We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies. Visualization tools and statistical methods are used to gain insights into the data.

###4. Train-Test Split###

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. Typically, 70-80% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 20-30% is used for testing.

###5. Logistic Regression Model###

A logistic regression model is implemented to predict the probability of a fraudulent transaction. Logistic regression is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification problems.

###6. Evaluation###

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curve are also used to assess the model's ability to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

###Conclusion###

This structured workflow provides a systematic approach to developing a credit card fraud detection system. By following these steps, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions and help prevent financial losses.
